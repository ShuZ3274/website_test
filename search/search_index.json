I was fortunate that McGill has a strong background in the field of astrophysics, hence many research opportunities and consistency if I choose to stay for the graduate programs, which I did. I was also lucky to be able to participate in a leading research on white dwarf composition. The work both my analytical and numerical skills, which I learned previously. I made a major contribution to the publication; that was my first chance to set foot in academia.</p> <p>I am now starting my master\u2019s (thesis) program at McGill, focusing on the fluid properties of compact objects like white dwarfs and neutron stars. It has been a new challenge to learn more deeply about fluid mechanics. It is a complex and chaotic system, which makes it interesting and constantly susceptible to new discoveries. This is what I signed up for, and what I like. In the future, I wish to continue this with a PhD degree, exploring more interesting concepts and more celestial objects, utilizing my ability to contribute to the field.</p> <p>I still remember the last course project in my third year of undergraduate study. My group was observing the Jupiter\u2019s moon period. Due to the high altitude, the observation period is quite short, making it difficult for us. In the chill Montreal night, waiting for dusk light to fade and the night sky to rise, I wondered if astronomers several hundreds of years ago had tried to catch a glimpse of light from a distant star, one that only appears in the sky for a moment. Share the light with the past, lay a foundation for future concepts, if I could help to, why not?</p>"},{"location":"about/#other-interests","title":"Other Interests","text":"<ul> <li>Cooking</li> <li>Languages</li> <li>Illustration</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/#cv","title":"CV","text":""},{"location":"about/cooking/","title":"Cooking","text":""},{"location":"about/cooking/#how-to-cook-lu-rou-fan-taiwanese-braised-pork-rice-bowl","title":"How to cook Lu Rou Fan (Taiwanese Braised Pork Rice Bowl)","text":""},{"location":"about/cooking/#ingredients","title":"Ingredients:","text":"<ul> <li>Pork belly with skin on, cut into strips</li> <li>Shallots</li> <li>Shiitake mushrooms, diced</li> <li>Eggs</li> <li>Garlic, minced</li> <li>Rock sugar</li> <li>soy sauce</li> <li>Shaoxing rice wine</li> <li>Chinese five-spice powder &amp; white pepper</li> <li>Rice</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/cooking/#procedures","title":"Procedures:","text":""},{"location":"about/cooking/#make-crispy-shallots","title":"make crispy shallots","text":"<p>Crispy shallots (fried shallots, \u6cb9\u8471\u9165) are an essential (and magical) ingredient for Lu Rou Fan.

They last for over 10 billion years before completely crystallizing. They are also commonly observed to be strongly magnetized. The origin of this strong magnetic field has always been mysterious. Several studies reveal a possible explanation: white dwarf\u2019s core crystallization imposes compositional convection, which, further combined with stellar rotation, could drive a dynamo, in analogy to Earth\u2019s core dynamo. In the past, this process was believed to be insufficient to support the large intensity of the observed magnetic field. A recent study, in which the author combines mixing-length theory with scalings from magnetorotational convection, shows possible higher convection velocity, sufficiently supporting observation with an estimation of field strength $\\sim 10^6$ \u2212 $10^8 G$. However, this is the strength of the initial magnetic field which starts only in the convection zone. After several billion years, the star cools down, and such a field diffuses and reveals itself at the star\u2019s surface. A loss in magnetic energy during the diffusion will reduce the field intensity. With numerical calculation, we found that for an initial field size of \u223c 0.2RWD \u22120.8RWD, the intensity of the surface field is $\\sim 10^{\u22124}$ \u2212 $10^{\u22121}$ of the original. This result is consistent with observations, making the core-convection mechanism a stronger argument.</p> <p>One way to simulate the evolution of white dwarf's magnetic field, in a small scale calculation,  is to employ a simple model which assumes that the field is spherical symmetrical. Then the 3D induction equation </p> <p>$$  \\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t} = - \\nabla \\times (\\eta \\nabala \\times \\vec{B}) $$</p> <p>can be reduced to a modified 1D radial equation, if the diffusivity profile is only function of position $\\eta(r)$</p> <p>$$  \\frac{\\partial R_l}{\\partial t} = \\eta(r) \\left[ \\frac{\\partial^2 R_l}{\\partial r^2} - \\frac{l(l+1)R_l}{r^2} \\right] $$</p> <p>Which is a simple diffusion equation with a modification term. This form is easily solvable by matrix operation.  Please refer to code on Github for methods in details.</p> <p>In the limit of first mode magnetic field (dipole) only, assumming some composition (details in this paper), the field could be caculated for a later time. It turns out that the maximum of field strength is roughly $10\\%$ of what started with. Here is an interesting figure from this paper showing different initial magnetic field sizes and their end stage: </p> <p>Full text of the paper and the code are avaliable on GitHub</p>"}]}
