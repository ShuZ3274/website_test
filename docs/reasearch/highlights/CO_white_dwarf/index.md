# C/O white dwarfs magnetic field

A very good application to the field evolution simulation tool I built in [Here](https://github.com/ShuZ3274/White-Dwarf) 
will be a calculation to potentially explain the crytallization of white dwarf core. Such crystallization produce a convection
behaviour in the immediate layer, which then acts as a dynamo producing a strong magnetic field. For details please refer to this [publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01807)
