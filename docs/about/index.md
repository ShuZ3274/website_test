# Introduction

I went to McGill for an undergrauated degree in physics major, I remain in McGill now persuing a master degree in physics with specialization in theoretical astrophysics. I focus on the electromagnetic properties and fluid behaviour in compact objects (i.e white dwarfs and neutron stars).


# Here is short story about me
In the last year of undergraduate study at McGill, I chose to focus on research work to prepare
myself for graduate study. I was fortunate that McGill has a strong background in the field of
astrophysics, hence many research opportunities and consistency if I choose to stay for the graduate
programs, which I did. I was also lucky to be able to participate in a leading research on white dwarf
composition. The work both my analytical and numerical skills, which I learned previously. I made
a major contribution to the publication; that was my first chance to set foot in academia.

I am now starting my master’s (thesis) program at McGill, focusing on the fluid properties of compact
objects like white dwarfs and neutron stars. It has been a new challenge to learn more deeply about
fluid mechanics. It is a complex and chaotic system, which makes it interesting and constantly
susceptible to new discoveries. This is what I signed up for, and what I like. In the future, I wish to
continue this with a PhD degree, exploring more interesting concepts and more celestial objects,
utilizing my ability to contribute to the field.

I still remember the last course project in my third year of undergraduate study. My group was
observing the Jupiter’s moon period. Due to the high altitude, the observation period is quite short,
making it difficult for us. In the chill Montreal night, waiting for dusk light to fade and the night sky
to rise, I wondered if astronomers several hundreds of years ago had tried to catch a glimpse of light
from a distant star, one that only appears in the sky for a moment. Share the light with the past, lay a
foundation for future concepts, if I could help to, why not?
