## How to cook Lu Rou Fan (Taiwanese Braised Pork Rice Bowl)

# Ingredients:

- Pork belly with skin on, cut into strips
- Shallots
- Shiitake mushrooms, diced
- Eggs
- Garlic, minced
- Rock sugar
- soy sauce
- Shaoxing rice wine
- Chinese five-spice powder & white pepper
- Rice

# Procedures:
# make crispy shallots
Crispy shallots (fried shallots, 油葱酥) are an essential (and magical) ingredient for Lu Rou Fan. They add an oniony taste and aromatic sweetness making the dish different from other types of Chinese style braised pork, such as the classic Hong Shao Rou (Red braised pork belly, 红烧肉). They also help to thicken the consistency of the broth.

Although shop-bought crispy shallots are available in most Chinese/Asian shops, I highly recommend you make your own if time permits. Believe me! It tastes so much better.

# cook the pork
Put the pork strips into an empty wok/pan over medium-high heat (you don’t need any oil). Stir occasionally to evenly heat the meat. You’ll see it changing colour and some oil appearing. So what you’re doing is actually frying the meat with its own fat. Once the pork gets golden slightly, add minced garlic and rock sugar (or white sugar). Fry until the garlic becomes fragrant and the sugar is melted.

Add the rest of the ingredients: light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, Shaoxing rice wine, five-spice powder, white pepper, diced shiitake mushroom, hard-boiled eggs and fried shallots (I like keeping some to use as a topping when assembling the dish). To add more aroma to the dish, I use the water in which the mushrooms were soaked as the braising liquid. Top up with more water if necessary to fully immerse the meat.

Once it comes to a full boil. Cover with a lid and turn down the heat to low. Leave to simmer for at least 1 hour until the pork becomes very tender and a little gelatinous.

# assemble the bowl
While you wait for the pork to cook, prepare another two elements of Lu Rou Fan: steamed rice and blanched green vegetable, such as Bok Choy, Choy Sum, Gai Lan, broccoli, etc.

Blanching vegetables is easy: bring a pot of water, with a little salt, to a full boil then add the vegetable (already washed and chopped). For leafy greens, it only takes 30 seconds or so to cook. Broccoli needs a little longer time. The goal is to cook it but retain its crunchiness. Overcooked vegetables often taste chewy or mushy which isn’t very pleasurable.

Put cooked rice into serving bowls then top with the vegetable. Use a knife (or a string) to halve the eggs. Add them and the pork over the rice. Sprinkle some leftover crispy shallots. Here you are! An all-in-one, scrumptious meal is ready to be served.
